									<h3>Mechanisms of intercommunication!</h3>
									<p>This community holds many areas of communication. These include hackathons, virtual meetups through Discord, and online forums (Stack Overflow). During hackathons- many computer science majors gather to compete in the creation of an app/website or anything innovative. Software developers may meet other software developers from all over the country (sometimes even the world). They learn new things from one another, make teams, and participate in games and challenges. On Discord there are many software development communities, including Visual Studios, C++, and cLion. Making sure you are part of one of the discord communities is very important as the help is so broad and accessible. On Discord, others may also participate in calls to help one another and start new discussions. On online forums, like Stack Overflow, if you are ever stuck on a code or a problem, you can always ask and several members within the forum are willing to help. You may also help others with their problems. </p>
